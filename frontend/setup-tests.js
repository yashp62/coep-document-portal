To complete the setup, you need to install the dependencies.
Please try one of these methods:

1. Fix your npm installation:
   curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh

2. Install Homebrew and Node.js:
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   brew install node
   
3. Use your existing Node.js installation:
   Make sure npm is properly installed with your Node.js version

After fixing npm, run:
   cd /Users/yashpardeshi/Desktop/sds/frontend
   npm install
   npm test

Your test files are ready in:
   - src/__tests__/components/
   - src/__tests__/pages/  
   - src/__tests__/store/
